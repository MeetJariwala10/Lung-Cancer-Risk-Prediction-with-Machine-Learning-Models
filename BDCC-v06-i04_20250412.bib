ABSTRACT = {The lungs are the center of breath control and ensure that every cell in the body receives oxygen. At the same time, they filter the air to prevent the entry of useless substances and germs into the body. The human body has specially designed defence mechanisms that protect the lungs. However, they are not enough to completely eliminate the risk of various diseases that affect the lungs. Infections, inflammation or even more serious complications, such as the growth of a cancerous tumor, can affect the lungs. In this work, we used machine learning (ML) methods to build efficient models for identifying high-risk individuals for incurring lung cancer and, thus, making earlier interventions to avoid long-term complications. The suggestion of this article is the Rotation Forest that achieves high performance and is evaluated by well-known metrics, such as precision, recall, F-Measure, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). More specifically, the evaluation of the experiments showed that the proposed model prevailed with an AUC of 99.3%, F-Measure, precision, recall and accuracy of 97.1%.},
